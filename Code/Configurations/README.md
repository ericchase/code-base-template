A place to keep copies and templates of your configuration and settings files that you use for software technologies.

Kinds of files you might want to save:

- .gitignore
- .prettierignore
- .prettierrc
- LICENSE-APACHE
- next.config.js
- package.json
- rustfmt.toml
- tauri.conf.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config

Literally any kind of file that you have to setup for new projects. It takes some effort updating these files, but it's definitely worth it.
